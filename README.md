## Atwinda Remote File Broswer

### Description

Atwinda Remote File Browser is a server/client based program.

The Server side of it allows the client to connect, and use the

following commands:

*Directory Listing

*Drive Listing

*Edit File

*File Listing

*PopUp messages

*Process listing

*Save File(make new files)

*Shutdown the Sever

*View File

b/c of the seriousness of the actions you can perform from the client

(file editing) the server can set command permissions. Event Logging,

and required login. All the default settings are in .rfd files (remote

file documents). don't delete the unblocked file. other wise u won't be

to set file permissions :(

The client is extreamly simple to use. once the user connects, they

select a comamnd (dirlist, filelist, etc...) and type a path, hit send

and boom, theres a list!

There is already another, better, version of this in the works with view

trees.
